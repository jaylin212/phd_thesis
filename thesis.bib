In principle, also a CP-conserving contribution to this process can arise within the Standard Model. We clarify the structure of the CP-conserving mechanism, analysing both its short-distance and long-distance components. It is pointed out that the calculation of the CP-conserving amplitude, although sensitive in part to non-perturbative physics, is quite well under control. The resulting CP-conserving contribution to the rate for KL→π0νν̄ turns out to be very strongly suppressed because of several factors, which we discuss in detail."

In that case this decay mode goes mainly through CP violating interference between mixing and decay. Consequently, a theoretically clean relation between the measured rate and electroweak parameters holds in any given model. Specificaly, Γ(KL → π0νν)Γ(K+ → π+νν) = sin2θ (up to known isospin corrections), where θ is the relative CP violating phase between the K - K mixing amplitude and the s → dνν decay amplitude. The experimental bound on BR(K+ → π+νν) provides a model independent upper bound: BR(KL → π0νν) < 1.1 × 10−8. In models with lepton flavor violation, the final state is not necessarily a CP eigenstate. Then CP conserving contributions can dominate the decay rate."

We construct the most general χPT Lagrangian for the weak vector-pseudoscalar-photon (VPγ) vertex for K → πγγ and KL → γγ∗ and consequently we get the full structure of the O(p6) local contributions generated by vector meson exchange. We then compute new factorizable contributions to the weak VPγ vertex generated by the odd-intrinsic parity violating Lagrangian with no additional couplings. We find in fact a very nice agreement with the phenomenology of K → πγγ and KL → γγ∗, more predictive power and a deeper understanding of the O(p6) local operators. A novel interpretation of the KL → γγ∗ data is given. Also a comparison with the existing models is presented."

Collimation lines and beamline components in the beamline have been optimized to suppress halo neutrons by utilizing the GEANT-3 Monte-Carlo simulation package. We have achieved the design with sharp cross-sectional profiles of the beam and the halo-to-core neutron flux ratio of 10−5 level."

We installed a new photon-veto detector, named the Inner Barrel (IB), to improve the detection efficiency and the timing resolution for photons in the region transverse to the neutral beam. The IB is a 2.8-m-long cylindrical detector with a 1.5 m inner diameter. The IB is a lead-scintillator sampling shower counter with a 5-radiation-length thickness and with a low mass support structure, and fits inside the 14-radiation-length-thick cylindrical detector. Scintillating light is read out from both ends via wavelength shifting fibers with a short decay time. The design, construction and performance of the IB are presented in this paper."

	abstract = {An acrylic Cherenkov counter named Beam Hole Guard Counter (BHGC) was developed as a photon-veto detector to cover the detection gap in the edge of the in-beam photon counter just outside of the beam core in the KOTO experiment. The KOTO experiment took physics data with the BHGC in 2015. We confirmed the stable operation and the expected performance of the BHGC. Therefore, the gap induced background can be rejected with the BHGC.}

The detector consists of two layers of 3âmm thick plastic scintillators with embedded wavelength-shifting fibers and multi-pixel photon counters for the readout. We manufactured the counter and evaluated the performance in terms of light yield, timing resolution, and efficiency. With this design, we achieved an inefficiency per layer against penetrating charged particles of less than \\$1.5 \\times 10^\\{-5\\}\\$, which satisfies the requirement of the KOTO experiment determined from simulation studies.}",

  abstract={We present a Pulse Shaping/Data Processing ADC Module for timing and energy measurements in High Energy Physics Experiments. The 6U VME Board has 16 channels at 14-BIT, 125MSPS, and was originally designed for KOTO, a Kaon experiment at Japan Particle Accelerator Research Complex (JPARC). Before being digitized, the differential inputs are amplified and shaped with low-pass filters, designed specifically for the scintillating material used in the experiment. Following shaping and sampling, data are fed to the on-board FPGA, and stored inside an adjustable pipeline memory, awaiting the trigger pulse. A digital data delay of up to 5,000 samples is possible. The Module can work independently, in a self-trigger mode, or it can be part of a large DAQ system with a unique system trigger. For sampling, the Module can use a locally generated clock, or it can work on a system level, simultaneous clock, provided at its front panel. After trigger, sets of data are packed and buffered. Depending on throughput requirements, the readout can be performed via the VME64 back plane or via the front-panel optical links. The powerful processing capabilities within the high-density FPGA allow for future design enhancements. Real-time local data processing and reduction algorithms can be implemented. The Module is fitted with two optical link transceivers at the front panel with 2.5 GBPS each. One optical link output is used for data read-out, and one for real-time total energy values. The two optical-link inputs are used to merge energy values calculated in other modules. By doing this, one can successively calculate the energy for the entire system and generate Level 1 triggers, with no additional hardware required. Design, module specifications, and test results will be described.},
